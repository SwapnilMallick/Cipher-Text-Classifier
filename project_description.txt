### Project Description ###
Design a classifier that can classify whether a piece of text is encoded or not.

### Method Name ###
Word Embedding + BiLSTM

### Representation of sentence ###
The text corpus is vectorized, by turning each text into a sequence of integers (each integer being the index of a token in a dictionary).

### Classifier ###
The first layer is the Keras Embedding layer, which is followed by a BiLSTM layer with 32 units and a Global Max Pooling Layer. A dense layer with 32 units and SELU activation, a dropout layer with a rate of 0.2 and another Dense layer with 16 units and SELU activation are the next three layers. 

### Training & Development ###
Adam Optimzer with a learning rate of 0.001 is used. Binary Crossentropy Loss and Early Stopping with a patience value of 5 are also used for training purpose.

### Other methods ###
Tried FFNN and GRU models

### Packages ###
Numpy, Pandas, Keras, Tensorflow
